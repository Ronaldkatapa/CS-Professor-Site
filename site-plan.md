## Research 

#### My research

Technology has revolutionized various aspects of modern life, but older adults often face challenges in adopting and utilizing these advancements. My research aims to explore the factors hindering the elderly's technology adoption and propose strategies to enhance technology's accessibility and applicability for this demographic.

### Challenges in Technology Adoption

Physical and cognitive limitations
Fear and lack of confidence
Limited access to training and support

### Strategies for Enhancing Technology Accessibility

User-friendly design
Accessibility training and support
Technology integration into everyday activities
Promote technology adoption through social circles


By addressing the challenges faced by older adults and implementing strategies to enhance technology accessibility, we can ensure that everyone can reap the benefits of technological advancements.
